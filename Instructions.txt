Letâ€™s look at a calculator class. We have a calculator class that allows us to add, subtract, multiple, and divide doubles. It does not have attributes so use a default constructor.

In the main method, ask for two doubles. Then print the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

For example, your output should look like this:

Enter two doubles:
 3.4
 1.6
3.4 + 1.6 = 5.0
3.4 - 1.6 = 1.7999999999999998
3.4 * 1.6 = 5.44
3.4 / 1.6 = 2.125
